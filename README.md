# Characterization of the aerodigestive tract microbiota in mechanically ventilated children â€“ a pilot study

### Aerodigestive microbiome 16S rRNA sequencing processing and analysis

To characterize the aerodigestive microbiota in mechanically ventilated children, we obtained gastric, oral, and tracheal samples from children who underwent surgery for spinal fusion or congenital heart disease. The oral, tracheal, and gastric communities were assessed using routine culture and molecular methods. 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained using the MiSeq Illumina platform and analyzed by QIIME2, with comparison to analysis using HOMINGS/ProbeSeq, a species-specific 16S rRNA-based probe search tool.
